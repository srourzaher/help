il y a plusieurs types de GC
-- Serial Garbage Collector:
It uses the only thread for garbage collection.
It works by holding all the threads of an application. It means that threads of the application freeze by the serial garbage collector during the garbage collection.
If you want to use the serial garbage collector, execute the -XX:+UseSerialGC

--Parallel Garbage Collector
The working of the parallel garbage collector is the same as the serial garbage collector.
The only difference between serial and parallel garbage collector is that serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process while the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.
If you want to use the parallel garbage collector, execute the -XX:+UseParallelGC

--Concurrent Mark and Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector
 CMS concurrently marks objects while the application runs and sweeps the unused objects at the end.
 CMS uses multiple threads that scan the heap and during the scanning, it marks the instances for eviction, after scanning.

 --Garbage First (G1) Garbage Collector
 The G1 garbage collector is used if we have a large (more than 4GB) memory (heap space). It divides the heap into equal-sized (usually 1MB to 32MB) chunks, prioritizes them, and then performs the parallel garbage collection on that chunks based on the priority.
 The Eden, survivors, and old areas use this equal-sized region for the memory allocation of the objects.
